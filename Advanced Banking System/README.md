				<---------PROJECT DESCRIPTION------>

Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called savings account and the other called as current account. The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book. The current account provides cheque book but no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.
Create a class account that stores customer name, account number and type of account. From this derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their requirements. Include necessary member functions in order to achieve the following task
Accept from a customer and update the balance
Display the balance
Compute the deposit interest
Permit withdrawal and update the balance
Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, and update the balance.
Write the program such that it saves the information in a file and with the following Menu Structure:
	1. New Customer
	2. Deposit
	3. Withdraw
	4. Check Balance
	5. List Customers
	6. Delete Customer
	7. Update Customer Details
	8. Exit System

In this project, the problem above was solved. For testing purposes, it is advised to clone the project locally into your machine and run the compile.sh script. The script will compile the entire source code into an executable file called "banking", which can be run from the console.
